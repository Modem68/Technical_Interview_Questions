## Test if a Binary Tree is balanced

Use the given Tree class and implement a function that returns whether the binary tree is balanced or not. 

An empty tree is considered height-balanced. 

A non-empty binary tree T is balanced if:
* Left subtree of T is balanced
* Right subtree of T is balanced
* The difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is not more than 1.
