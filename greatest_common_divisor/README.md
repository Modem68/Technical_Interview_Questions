## Compute the greatest common divisor

Write a function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) between two numbers. Recall that the GCD of two numbers, a and b, is defined as follows:

---------------

**gcd(a, b) = b, if a is divisible by b**

**gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a%b), otherwise**
   
---------------
